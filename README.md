## Problem Scenario

In today's world, many individuals face health challenges due to unhealthy meal patterns. Most meal-ordering platforms prioritize sales and user preferences while overlooking the impact of meals on users' health.

## Solution Application

The **My Meal App** is designed to bridge this gap by providing a platform that not only facilitates meal ordering but also promotes healthier eating habits. The app considers usersâ€™ health status, tracks their nutrition levels, and offers personalized AI-based suggestions for improved well-being.

### Key Features

1. **Health-Centric Meal Recommendations**
   - The app uses a macronutrient-based algorithmic logic to assess users' health status and recommend meals accordingly.
   - All user meal orders are stored in a database, and this data is utilized by the algorithm to provide accurate health status and suggestions.

2. **User Metadata Integration**
   - During registration, users provide essential metadata such as gender, activity level, and goals.
   - This information is incorporated into the algorithm to enhance the precision of health status calculations.

3. **Meal Scanning for External Meals**
   - Users may consume meals outside the app. The meal scanning feature allows users to scan their meals and receive a detailed nutritional report.
   - The scanned meal nutrition data is stored in the database and used in health status calculations, improving accuracy even for meals not ordered through the app.

4. **Play the Game and Earn Coins**
   - To boost user engagement, the app includes a game where users can play and earn coins.
   - These coins can be used to pay for meals.
   - Users can only play the game if their health status remains within a healthy range. If the health status is unhealthy, access to the game is restricted.
   - To maintain business balance, the coin collection rate and coin economic value are strategically adjusted by the game physics.

### Focus Areas

The **My Meal App** prioritizes:
- **User Health**: By promoting healthier meal choices and tracking nutritional levels.
- **User Experience**: With a seamless and intuitive platform & rsponsive user interfaces.
- **User Engagement**: Through gamification and reward systems to keep users motivated and involved.
- **Business Sustainability**: By strategically adjusting the coin collection rate and coin economic value to maintain financial balance.
